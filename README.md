# Four-in-A-Row
A text-based version of the classic "Four In A Row" game with an AI component that can play against a human player. The game, coded in Python using standard libraries, allows two players to take turns dropping their tokens into a grid, aiming to connect four tokens in a row, column, or diagonal.
